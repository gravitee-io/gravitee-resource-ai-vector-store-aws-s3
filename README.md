## 🧑‍💼 Multi-Tenant Isolation via Metadata

To enable multi-tenant isolation, include a unique context key (`retrieval_context_key`) in the metadata of each vector when adding. Queries can be filtered using this metadata key. Deletions are not filtered by this key in the resource implementation.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Initialization:** On startup, the resource ensures the S3 bucket and index exist, creating them if necessary. The index is created with the dimension and distance metric specified in `properties`.
2. **Adding Vectors:** Vectors are added one at a time. If `allowEviction` is enabled, an `expireAt` metadata field is set. If `retrieval_context_key` is present in metadata, it is stored for isolation.
3. **Querying Vectors:** Queries can filter by `retrieval_context_key` in metadata. Results include similarity/distance scores and metadata.
4. **Removing Vectors:** Vectors are removed by key. No metadata filtering is applied to deletions.
5. **Eviction:** The resource only tags vectors with `expireAt`; consumers must implement their own cleanup logic to remove expired vectors.

---

## 🧠 Example Usage Pattern

1. **Create a vector bucket and index** via AWS Console, CLI, SDK, or let the resource create them. Set dimensions and distance metric via configuration.
2. **Insert vectors** one at a time using the resource API. Each vector has a unique key, float32 embedding matching `embeddingSize`, and metadata. Include `retrieval_context_key` in metadata for multi-tenant isolation if desired.
3. **Query vectors** using the resource API, optionally filtering on `retrieval_context_key` in metadata, and returning similarity/distance scores and metadata.
4. **Delete vectors** using the resource API by key. No metadata filtering is applied to deletions.
5. **Eviction** (if enabled): Vectors are tagged with `expireAt` in metadata. Consumers must periodically remove expired vectors.

## ✅ Features
- Fully managed, no infrastructure to run or patch
- Scales to millions/billions of vectors and thousands of indexes
- Low-cost, up to 90% cheaper than dedicated vector DBs
- Strong read-after-write consistency (provided by AWS S3 Vectors)
- Fine-grained IAM-based access control
- Seamless integration with Bedrock Knowledge Bases and OpenSearch
- Multi-tenant isolation via metadata keys

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- No automatic eviction: expired vectors are only tagged; consumers must remove them
- Only single vector operations are supported (no batch insert)
- Deletions are by key only; no metadata filtering
- Index distance metric is set via `similarity` property

---

## 🗃 Supported Similarity Functions

- `COSINE`: Ideal for normalized embeddings.
- `EUCLIDEAN`: Computes L2 distance.
> **Note:** The index’s distance metric is set from the `similarity` property and must match your embeddings.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Amazon Bedrock
- Semantic search over large document/media sets
- Agent memory/context vector storage
- Multi-tenant indexing (via metadata keys)
